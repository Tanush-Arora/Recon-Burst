                CEH stands for Certified Ethical Hacker, and it is arguably the best known of all the available EC-Council certifications. It was designed to indicate that the holder understands how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in computer systems and is proficient with the tools used by a malicious hacker. 
                <br><br>
                Holding a CEH certification indicates the holder has acquired essential skills required to work in the following roles, among others:
                <br><br>

        The CEH exam is a 125-question multiple-choice exam. Candidates have four hours to complete the CEH exam. Since all questions are multiple-choice, test-takers rarely run out of time during the exam. Many candidates report needing only two to three hours to complete this test. 
        <br><br>
        EC-Council uses several different exam forms. An exam form is a bank of questions administered as a version of the test. EC-Council uses a process of rating each question to ensure that each of their multiple exam forms reflects an equal assessment of the test taker’s knowledge. 
        <br><br>
        Post exam reports indicate that topics covered include hacking methodologies, scanning methodologies, port scan types, and expected return responses. Knowing how to work with tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, Snort, OpenSSL, Netstat, and Hping is reported as being useful for test-takers. 
        People that have taken the exam invariably report that the exam is challenging and that adequate study before sitting for the exam is necessary—many people study for months in preparation for the CEH exam.
        <br><br>
        Successful candidates often report that a measured study program that consists of a few hours each day over a long period of time is helpful. There are many practice tests available online.
        <br><br>
        When taking the exam at a physical testing center, the exam will be proctored by authorized personnel at the testing center. Exams can be taken at Pearson VUE testing centers. EC-Council has Pearson VUE test centers located within many of their Accredited Training Centers.
        <br><br>
        A CEH exam passing score can range from 60 percent to 85 percent depending on which exam form, or bank of questions, is administered for that specific exam. Because the difficulty of any bank of questions will vary, so will the corresponding passing score.
